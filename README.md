# Optimal-scheduling-of-vehicle-charging-considering-load-distribution-based-on-PSO-algorithm
Abstract:
With the full development of electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging has now become the most important factor affecting the load on the power grid, in order to solve the impact of large-scale charging of electric vehicles on the load on the power grid, the charging grid load total variance is minimised as the objective function is established. At the same time, in order to satisfy and achieve efficient and correct solution. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimise the charging time. The static charging model and the charging model under dynamic scheduling are established considering the grid load constraints. At the same time, we verify the feasibility of the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm in solving this problem using the relevant function models. At the end of the algorithm, we test the generalisation ability of the model generated by the PSO using different number of iterations, different number of EVs and completely different samples of EVs.
